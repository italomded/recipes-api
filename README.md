# Recipes API

Cooking recipes REST API. Created to practice learning.

The core idea of the API is to search for recipes based on ingredients. Therefore, the user always looks for recipes that he can make with what he has at home, dispensing with those that have ingredients that he does not have.

- `/api/docs` for JSON version;
